# NeIC ESM application

## Significance

**Benefits**

- More Earth System Modeling simulations done in less time
- Homogeneous workflows to post-process ESM model outputs for evaluating the impact of climate change in the Nordics (independently of the Earth System Model used i.e. NorESM, or EC-EARTH or GISS modelE)
- Common diagnostic tools/workflows for highlighting Climate impact in the Nordics
- Reduce cost (performance and energy efficiency) of ESM simulations
- Possibility to have a joint Nordic CMIP participation
- Benefit for all ESM researchers in the Nordic, even those not involved in the project and/or CMIP
- Climate data would be easier to use, even for non-specialists


## Research community

## National and international context

## The Nordics and NeIC

## Services and tools

### Activities

- **Activity A**: Model analysis and diagnostics focused on the Nordic regions
- **Activity B**: FAIR climate data for norESM, and EC-EARTH and GISS modelE
- **Activity C**: ESM workflows for efficiently running NorESM, and EC-EARTH and GISS modelE on euroHPC


#### Activity A:

- 3 ESMValTool diagnostic modules of interest to Nordic countries (eg, polar lows, European and Greenland blocking events) with strong emphasis on (high-latitude) observations (and "observation simulators" to some extent) 
- A Common platform for common EC-EARTH, and NorESM and GISS modelE analysis comparisons for Nordics to facilitate scientific collaboration


#### Activity B: FAIR Climate data for Nordics

- 1  face to face training for ESGF publication and regular virtual meeting for ESGF admin
- 1  face to face training for learning how to publish on ESGF node 
- 1 hackathon with FAIR specialists and ESM specialists to understand what needs to be done for making Climate data FAIR (for norESM, and EC-EARTH and GISS modelE)
- 1 training material on how to generate FAIR climate data (and metadata) FAIR
		- ESDOC analysis, can we use ESDOC for Nordic other climate simulationsit, does it need to be expanded? 
		- Make sure current initiatives are taken into account
- 1 Train the Trainer workshop on FAIR climate data using the training material developed within the project (e.g. https://indico.neic.no/event/56/).
- 1 Data Management Plan Template for Nordic Climate Data


#### Activity C: ESM workflows for efficiently running both NorESM,  and EC-EARTH and GISS modelE on EuroHPC

- 1 training material on workflow tools for ESM (cylc, galaxy or snakemake)
- 1 training material on performance analysis for NorESM, and EC-EARTH and GISS modelE
- 1 Train the Train workshop on Performance Optimisation and Productivity of Nordic Earth System Modeling
- Containerization (singularity/docker) for running NorESM, and EC-EARTH and GISS modelE
- Benchmark for EuroHPC with norESM, and EC-EARTH and GISS modelE, using a common workflow manager (cylc, galaxy or snakemake)
- 1 face to face meeting with Nordic EuroHPC representatives to coordinate feedback on requirement for efficient use of resources specifically for the climate community
- 1 public report on the best approach for using efficiently EuroHPC for the Nordic Climate Community with guidance on performance versus energy efficiency
