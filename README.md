## Call

- https://neic.no/news/2019/03/13/open-call/

## Problems


- Climate models/tools are not specifically developed and/or tuned to provide deep insights into climate change impacts on Nordic environments, economies and societies as a whole
- Making the best use of EUROHPC requires fundamental upgrading of the entire workflows and strategies for tackling issues related to exascale computing (access to data, hardware failures, scalability, etc.).
- Insufficient e-infrastructure & services as well insufficient expertise to adapt and apply FAIR principles to Climate science
